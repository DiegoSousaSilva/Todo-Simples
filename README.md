## Simple Todo App

It is a simple project, which lists task items using a public API located at  [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos), and also has an `input` used to add a new item to the list and with the option to delete an item.

### `Hooks`

With React `Hooks` you can use a state and manage the class-based lifecycle logic within the function components. With that you can write a more readable, concise and clear code.
